Many existing users may not log in regularly, or they might be unsure how to access their account after installation. This guide is tailored specifically for existing users and outlines the step-by-step process to successfully log in to a previously created Webroot account, along with troubleshooting common issues that may arise.

Understanding the Webroot Account
---------------------------------

A Webroot account is automatically created when a user purchases and registers Webroot SecureAnywhere or any of its related products. As an existing user, you should already have:

- A **registered email address** linked to your account
- A **password** set during initial registration
- Access to a **device or browser** for signing in

This login information grants you access to the Webroot management console, where you can make updates, add new devices, renew subscriptions, and check your protection status.

Why Login Is Important for Existing Users
-----------------------------------------

Logging into your Webroot account as an existing user provides multiple benefits:

- **Check Subscription Details**: View your active licenses, expiration dates, and plan type.
- **Manage Devices**: Add or remove protected devices.
- **Access Installers**: Download installation files for other computers or mobile devices.
- **Renew or Extend Services**: Upgrade your subscription before expiration.
- **Monitor Security Events**: See past scan results and threat detections.
- **Update Personal Information**: Change your password or email settings if needed.

How to Login Webroot as an Existing User
----------------------------------------

If you’ve already registered with Webroot and wish to log in to your account, follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Your Web Browser**

- Use a secure and updated browser such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari, or Microsoft Edge.
- Ensure your device is connected to the internet.

**Step 2: Visit the Webroot Login Page**

- In the browser's address bar, type in the Webroot login page URL.
- This page contains fields for your email address and password.

**Step 3: Enter Your Registered Email Address**

- Type in the email address you used when setting up your Webroot account.
- Make sure there are no spelling errors, and check for unnecessary spaces.

**Step 4: Input Your Password**

- Carefully enter your account password into the password field.
- Passwords are case-sensitive, so make sure CAPS LOCK is turned off.
- If you’ve forgotten your password, you can initiate a reset using the “Forgot Password” option.

**Step 5: Complete Two-Factor Authentication (If Applicable)**

- If you enabled two-factor authentication, a verification code will be sent to your email or authenticator app.
- Enter the code within the time limit to proceed.

**Step 6: Access Your Dashboard**

- Once logged in successfully, you will see the Webroot account dashboard.
- From here, you can navigate through different panels such as Devices, Account Info, and Subscription.

Troubleshooting Login Issues for Existing Users
-----------------------------------------------

Even as an existing user, you may encounter difficulties when trying to access your account. Below are common issues and how to fix them.

**Incorrect Email or Password**

- Double-check your login credentials.
- Try typing your credentials manually instead of relying on auto-fill.
- Reset your password if needed.

**Forgotten Password**

- Click the “Forgot Password” link on the login screen.
- Enter your registered email address.
- Check your inbox for a reset email and follow the instructions.

**Email Not Recognized**

- Ensure you are using the email you originally registered with Webroot.
- If you have multiple email addresses, try logging in with each one.
- Look at your purchase confirmation or previous Webroot emails to verify.

**Two-Factor Authentication Not Working**

- Make sure your mobile device or email account is accessible to receive the code.
- Enter the code promptly before it expires.
- If you're unable to receive the code, recovery options may be available within your account settings.

**Account Locked**

- Too many failed login attempts can temporarily lock your account.
- Wait a few minutes before trying again or perform a password reset.

**Browser-Related Issues**

- Clear your browser cache and cookies.
- Switch to another browser or try using private/incognito mode.
- Make sure your browser is up to date.

What to Do If You No Longer Have Access
---------------------------------------

If you are unable to recover your login credentials using the reset options, consider the following steps:

- Check if someone else in your household or office created the account using a different email.
- Review all your email inboxes for any registration or purchase confirmation emails from Webroot.
- Reinstalling the Webroot software using your product keycode may allow you to link back to your existing account during setup.

To maintain easy access to your Webroot account, follow these best practices:

- **Store Credentials Securely**: Use a password manager to keep track of your login information.
- **Enable Two-Factor Authentication**: Add an extra layer of protection to your account.
